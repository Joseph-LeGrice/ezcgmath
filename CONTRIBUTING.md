# Contributing
Hi! Thanks for coming all this way!

Unfortunately, ezcgmath isn't ready for open source contributions 
just yet (there's still a few things I'd like to implement myself!). However, I will definitely be taking 
them in the future.

If there's something you'd like to contribute, or a missing feature you think should be on my radar, please feel free to open an issue saying so!
